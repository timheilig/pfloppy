Python font parser


This is very much a work in progress. The end-goal is a lightweight library to allow font instrospection, and perhaps small edits or change in format (from type1 to type1C for example).

This is not intended to replace full featured font editors like fontforge, however it has already been useful in identifying font parsing bugs in fontforge.
